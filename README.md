# brioche-calc
I believe the best way to learn is hands on and crossing passions and knowlegde.
I will use my passion for baking to fuel my motivation to learn python.
This code will probably be useless to most humans on Earth including me, but I don't care.
The final destination deosn't matters, only the journey.
